My plan is for my website to allow users to look up statistics about wind turbines, such as finding the wind turbine in the US with the highest electrical generation capacity, or finding the tallest wind turbine in the US. However, if I have time, I also want my website to have graphs visualizing statistics such as the amount of wind turbines built each year, the average capacity of all wind turbines built in one year, the number of wind turbines in a specific county/state, and much more.
